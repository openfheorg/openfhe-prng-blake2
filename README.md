External PRNG Engine (Blake2) for OpenFHE
=====================================

This example demonstrates how to develop external PRNG engines as shared objects. It is an experimental feature currently available only on Linux, and g++ is the required compiler for linking the shared object.

Below are the steps to follow to create a new PRNG:
1. Create a repo (or directory) for your custom engine.
2. Create a new class similar to [Blake2Engine](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-prng-blake2/blob/main/src/include/blake2engine.h):
    * copy [prng.h](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development/blob/main/src/core/include/utils/prng/prng.h) from OpenFHE to your repo. The class PRNG defined in prng.h must be used as the base class for the new class. prng.h is not allowed to be changed.
    * only two public member functions are needed for the class: a constructor with 2 input parameters (seed array and counter) and operator()
    * create extern "C" function "createEngineInstance" returning a dynamically allocated object of the new class. As the function is called from OpenFHE using dlsym() you may not change its current name.
3. Link your new engine library as a shared object. See [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-prng-blake2/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt) as an example if you use cmake.
4. Add a call to PseudoRandomNumberGenerator::InitPRNGEngine() at the beginning of your applicationâ€˜s main(). This function takes the absolute path to your shared object. If you call InitPRNGEngine() without argument or do not call it at all, then your application will use the built-in PRNG engine (blake2).

The indication of using an external PRNG engine is a trace from the application "InitPRNGEngine: using external PRNG". There no trace for the built-in PRNG. 

To quickly test if OpenFHE uses your new shared object or/and see how to call InitPRNGEngine() see [external-prng.cpp](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development/blob/main/src/core/examples/external-prng.cpp). The example prints its usage if run with the option "-h".
